                You're so pretty when you cry, when youn cry, wasn't ready to hear you, say goodbye, now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart, tearing me apart, 
                You're so london, your own style, your own style, and together we're so good, so girl why, are you tearing me apart? tearing me apart, tearing me apart
                Did I do something stupid, yeah, girl if I blew it, just tell me what I did, let's work through it, there's gotta be someway to get you to want me, like 
                before

                Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress, and it hurts cause you wont be mine tonight, no one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile, baby tell me
                how to make it right, now all of my friends said, it's not really worth it, even if its thats true, no one in the world could stop me from not moving on, 
                even if I wanted to, nobody compares to you.
