                You're so pretty when you cry, when you cry
                Wasn't ready to hear you say goodbye
                Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart
                You're tearing me apart
                You're so London your own style, your own style
                And together we're so good so girl why
                Are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart
                You're tearing me apart
                Did I do something stupid, yeah, girl if I blew it
                Just tell me what I did, let's work through it
                There's gotta be some way to get you to want me like before
                Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress
                And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
                No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
                Baby tell me how to make it right
                Now all my friends say it's not really worth it
                But even if that's true
                No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
                Baby even if I wanted to
                Nobody compares to you
                We're so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed
                I remember the taste of your lipstick
                Now you're tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart
                You're tearing up my heart
                Did I do something stupid, yeah, girl if I blew it

            ately I found myself thinking (thinking)
Been dreaming about you a lot (a lot)
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend (boyfriend)
But that's one thing you've already got
He drives to school every morning (morning)
While I walk alone in the rain (in the rain)
He'd kill me without any warning (warning)
If he took a look in my brain
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would
Back in my head, we were kissing
I thought things were going alright (alright, alright, alright)
With a sign on my back saying, "Kick me"
Reality ruined my life (go, Tommo, go)
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got 27 tattoos
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would
I would, I would
Would he please you? Would he kiss you?
Would he treat you like I would? (I would)
Would he touch you? Would he need you?
Would he love you like I would?
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would
Would he please you? (Would he please you?)
Would he kiss you? (Would he kiss you?)
Would he treat you like I would? (Like I would)
Would he touch you? (Would he touch you?)
Would he need you? (Would he need you?)
Would he love you like I would?
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would (like I would)
Would he hold you when you're feeling low?
Baby, you should know that I would (oh)
I would (yeah), I would (yeah)
